Filenames with "-plain" are saved as plain svg files.

Filenames with "-optimized" are saved as optimized svg files.
Note that I may have done some manual editing of these afterwards.

Filenames with "-original" are Inkscape svg files.

Otherwise, the file is the optimized version if there exists a file with "-original" in its name, or the Inkscape svg if there exists a file with "-optimized" in its name.
